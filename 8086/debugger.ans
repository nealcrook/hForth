\
\
\ The following code provides a simple debugging tool for ANSI Forth
\ programs. It may be used to debug colon- and DOES>- and :NONAME-code
\ on source level.
\
\ The debugger expects your system to be a well behaved Forth system.
\ (Like my F68KANS :-)
\ When you suspect that your problems arise from the compiler itself
\ (do you use an optimizer?), please use another tool.
\
\
\ Usage:
\
\ There are two pairs of words switching the debugger on and off.
\
\ +DEBUG, -DEBUG
\ These two control a global switch, which has effects both a compile-
\ and runtime. When used at compiletime, -DEBUG will completely switch
\ of the debugger. So no debugging code is generated. This allows you
\ to leave your code with all debugging statements in it and test it
\ without debugger.
\ At runtime, -DEBUG switches off the evaluation of debugging code.
\ So your code will behave as normal, just a bit slower.
\
\ [DBG, DBG]
\ You will have to use [DBG at compiletime in front of a ':' or a DOES>
\ to tell the debugger to generate special debugging code. [DBG is
\ valid until switched off with DBG]. DBG] may appear anywhere in the source!
\ So it is possible to debug only the first part of a word and then to switch
\ of the debugger causing 'original' code to be generated for the rest.
\ It is not possible to generate normal code a the beginning of a definition
\ and debugging code in the end!
\
\ E.g.
\ : FOO CREATE [DBG  0 ,   DOES> @ ;   DBG]
\
\ will only debug the DOES>-part of the definition. The reason is that [DBG
\ only switches the behaviour of ':' and DOES>.
\
\
\ Think about the difference of +-DEBUG and [DBG]!
\
\
\ There some additional words to control the debugger a runtime. These
\ words have short names to be typepable at debugtime. But of course
\ you may also compile them into your code. Thsi gives you the
\ possibility to realize breakpoints etc.
\
\ [+I], [-I]
\ Interactive. This switch controls wether you do singlestepping or a
\ kind of code animation. When singlestepping, you can type any number
\ of Forth statements between two steps. The next step is peformed when
\ simply pressing <return>.
\
\ [+V], [-V]
\ Verbose. [+V] adds a stack dump to the output on each step.
\
\ [+S], [-S]
\ Silent. [+S] switches off all outputs and the program begins to run.
\ Pressing a key switches it back to interactive mode.
\
\ [>L] ( n -- )
\ Goto Level of nesting. This option recieves a parameter (don't forget).
\ It lets the debugger run in '[+S] [-I] [-V]'-mode until the given
\ level of nesting is reached the next time. Then the previous state of
\ the debugger is restored.
\ Note that the given level may be lower, higher or equal to the current level.
\ You can overwrite the settings invoked be [>L] with further debugger
\ commands.
\ Suppose you are on level 1, than
\    1 [>L] [-S]
\ will give you an animation of your code until the next word on nestinglevel 1
\ is reached.
\
\ [Y]
\ Step over. This command will avoid nesting to deeper levels. It is
\ equivalent to a [>L] with the current level. So the example above can
\ be written as:
\    [Y] [-S]
\
\
\ [DEF]
\ Default: [+I] [-V] [-S], no nestlevel targeting
\
\
\ The debugger also supports a decompiler feature for words compiled with the
\ debugger on. The decompiler is envoked by
\
\ DSEE <name>
\
\ and decompiles the whole word at once. For this decompiler works completely
\ different from these you maybe know, it has e.g. the possibility to
\ decompile even things which were in you source with the compiler off.
\ This means, sequences like '... [ 1 2 3 + + ] LITERAL ...' will
\ reappear while decompiling.
\
\
\ 0!DBG
\
\ This is the debugger's reset. It sets back e.g. the level of nesting.
\ You should use this at the beginning of a file you compile, e.g.
\      0!DBG
\ in the first line.

\ ENVIRONMENTAL DEPENDENCIES
\
\ When the decompiler option is used:
\   The Control Stack (CS) has to be the data stack.
\
\
\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\ RESTRICTIONS:
\
\ The generation of debugging code can only be invoked with the words
\ ':', DOES> and :NONAME (or words which use them, after the debugger
\ has been compiled).
\
\ The debugger is steered by some string literals: debugging is switched
\ off when the debugger's outer interpreter finds the words DBG] or ';'.
\ The words a compiled as string literals into the debugger, so no
\ definitions including them will be able to do theire job!
\ Further, the words ';' and '[' have a special meaning for the
\ debugger (they both switch off the Forth compiler).
\
\ In the current state, the debugger cannot handle floating point
\ literals. This will be removed in one of the next releases.
\
\
\
\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\ HOW IT WORKS
\
\ A standard system does not let you examine the code. You do not know
\ anything about it's location in memory or it's structure. You do not
\ know wether it is direct or inderect threaded or native code.
\ But most debuggers exactly do that: they examine the code, and sometimes
\ even modify it at runtime (e.g. to set breakpoints in native code systems).
\ They need detailed knowledge about the code and the CPU it runs on.
\ In most cases, additional knowledge about the structure of the
\ dictionary is needed, too.
\
\ For all that cannot be done with an ANSI Forth system, this debugger
\ tries a completely different way.
\ From the things said above, it is clear that once the code is
\ generated, there is no possibility for debugging any more. So an ANSI
\ debugger has to generate a special debugging code. In order to do that,
\ it must define a new compiler, because an ANSI system does not
\ let you manipulate the outer interpreter.
\ My debugger uses an own outer interpreter which generates, let's say,
\ 'self debugging code'.
\ (Thanks to the standard comittee for providing REFILL)
\
\ The next serious problem is how to access the source? There are
\ different input sources like TIB, files, blocks or strings. Perhaps for
\ blocks it would be possible to compile the blocknumber into the code.
\ Then the right block could be accessed at runtime.
\ Files would be more complicated, because they are represented by a
\ single number, which may be OS dependent. Reaccessing a file from
\ this number later means to implement a completely new
\ file word set. I did not want to do that!
\ With source from TIB or a string, the source retrieval will be
\ impossible at all.
\ So the only way to solve the problem is to compile the source together
\ with the generated code!
\ (Thanks to the standard comittee for providing SLITERAL)
\
\ The following code is generated (in general) for a Forth word <word>:
\
\	[ S" <word>" ] SLITERAL dodebug nodecomp @ IF <word> THEN
\
\ (So make sure that you have enough space in your code area!)
\

\  REMARKS
\
\ V0.2 initially did not work with Wil Baden's thisForth.
\ The reason seemed to be
\ that VALUES cannot be POSTPONEd in thisForth. So I turned the VALUE
\ 'decompile' into the VARIABLE 'nodecomp'.
\ thisForth had (has?) some problems with it's REFILL. Wil Baden send
\ me a valid definition:
\
\  : REFILL ( -- flag ) next-char eof <> ;
\
\ Don't wonder about what you see when debugging thisForth programs!
\ The debugger also sees thisForth's macro expansions!!
